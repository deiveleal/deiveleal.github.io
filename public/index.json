[{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-entrepreneurship\"\u003eAbout Entrepreneurship\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntrepreneurship is such a magic word that can either change reality or, it is at least, what some people think it does. With hype words and sex meaning, many people believe that entrepreneurship it’s the key to develop or increase value in society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that people create a mythology around the entrepreneur and their performance on a regular basis. Anyone can be an entrepreneur, investing time and money and success is guaranteed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut is it true? When a person doesn’t have any option to make money, can he be considered an entrepreneur? Or when he is poor and the only thing that he can use is his labor force, can he be an entrepreneur? Can we accept that a delivery person is an entrepreneur just because they use their own motorcycles or bicycles to do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is: this kind of person is not an entrepreneur, but a survivor. They need to accept any kind of work or they will be hungry and unable to feed their families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntrepreneurship is not a magic word that can change reality just because some people believe it. It’s not true and the reality, even in success, it’s not simple. When a person achieves good results, countless people don’t get more benefits than any ordinary employee with few guaranties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Brazil, currently, there are around nine million unemployed people. Some of them don’t believe they can get a job anymore, so they quit trying. Others have been looking for two years or more. Consequently, if these people do anything to make money, they are not entrepreneurs but survivors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t believe in any mythology about entrepreneurship, in general they talk just about glamorous and successful cases and do not say anything about the failures. Anyway, failure is not beautiful and cannot be sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferences:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCAVALLINI Marta.
